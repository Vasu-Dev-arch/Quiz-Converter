Chatgpt and perplexity are working.
chatgpt :
    - No GUI (for now)
    - Input files must be in the same location as chat.py
    - works better than perplexity.
    - still not completely working.
    - Run by : python chat.py "Input(Phy_NoLines).docx" "Output.docx"
    
perplexity has minimal GUI
